            Our Mandate for ministry was received from the LORD Himself, in an
            18 hour vision. During this vision, a commission was received from
            the LORD to liberate mankind in all facets of human existence, to
            restore broken destinies, to bring healing to the infirmed. This was
            the Divine mandate received from the LORD.

              Now the hour has come to liberate the world from all oppressions
              of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith, and I am
              sending you to undertake this task Today, testimonies of
              liberation through our messages, books, tapes, magazines and other
              periodicals are most humbling. The word of faith is working like
              fire for the liberation of mankind across the nations.

              God commissioned the presiding Bishop of this commission with a
              Word of Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said,
              "...if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
              himself to the battle?" (1 Cor 14:8) As a Commission, we have
              experienced amazing testimonies ever since this commission was
              handed down - that is over thirty years now! The Holy Ghost
              further inspired the servant of God, Dr. David Oyedepo, to
              classify the Word of Faith He has committed into his hands into
              the specific areas of emphasis, in direct response to Isaiah 40:6,
              "The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?..."
              <br />
              <br />
              He has named these 12 areas of emphasis as the 12 Pillars of our
              Commission. We have crossed Jordan into power, bearing the ark of
              liberation. Here are the 12 stones, after the order of Joshua
              4:1-8, 20-24. Having stood firm upon these twelve stones! And they
              have resulted in breakthroughs - both for the ministry and all
              that are partakers with us, of the same grace.
